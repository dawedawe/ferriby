# ferriby

Keep Ferrises alive and happy by feeding them commits in your repositories.  
They can live in a local or a GitHub repository.

![Ferriby demo recording](./vhs/ferriby.gif)

## Usage

```shell
ferriby -gh owner/repository
```

```shell
ferriby -g path_to_local_repository
```

You can use ferriby with multiple repositories at once

```shell
ferriby -g local_path -gh owner/repo -g other_path -gh ...
```

## Configuration

To access private GitHub repos or to have a higher rate limit for the checks,
you can pass a PAT (Personal Access Token) to ferriby via the environment variable `FERRIBY_GH_PAT`.  
Create your PAT in the [settings section](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) with `Repository permissions` of `Read`.
Test it with

```shell
FERRIBY_GH_PAT="xyz" ferriby -gh owner/repository
```

## Advisory

This is gamification. If you have a human to love or a dog to walk, do that!
