# ferriby

Keep ferribies alive and happy by feeding them commits in your repositories.  
A ferriby can live in a local or a GitHub repository.

The ASCII art is based on work by [Diggory Blake](https://github.com/diggsey). Thanks!

# Usage:

```shell
ferriby <owner> <repository>
```

```shell
ferriby <path_to_local_repository>
```
