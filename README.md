# ferriby

Keep ferris alive and happy by feeding them commits in your repositories.  
They can live in a local or a GitHub repository.

# Usage:

```shell
ferriby <owner> <repository>
```

```shell
ferriby <path_to_local_repository>
```

# Configuration

To access private GitHub repos or to have a higher rate limit for the checks, you can pass a PAT (Personal Access Token) to ferriby 
via the environment variable `FERRIBY_GH_PAT`.
Create your PAT in the [settings section](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) with `Repository permissions` of `Read`.
Test it with

```shell
FERRIBY_GH_PAT="xyz" ferriby owner repository
```
